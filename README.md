# Quantic-Tac-Toe
**Quantic-Tac-Toe** is a mind-bending twist on the classic game, where each of the nine spaces exists in a quantum superposition of both X and O. As the game progresses, the weights or probabilities of the spaces shift based on player decisions, leading to a final "collapse" into a traditional Tic Tac Toe board once the game concludes.
